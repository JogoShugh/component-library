# Component Implementation

- component styling is powered by [fela](https://fela.js.org)
- every component should render a `StyleProvider` as its root component ([see StyleProvider package](/packages/style-provider))
- use `createComponent` function to create styled elements ([see StyleContainer package](/packages/style-container))

> after creating a brand **new component package**, don't forget to run **`yarn bootstrap`**

## Component Organization

- every component has a dedicated directory under `./components`
- every component has a `package.json` file in root with a `main` and `main:src` value
- every package contains a `files` value in `package.json`
- every component package has a build NPM script value
- source code belongs in a `src` directory

## Default vs Named Exports

Component packages should always export the main component as the default export. Other named exports are also allowed to be publicly exposed; just be sure to document them, too.

## Dependencies

Use yarn workspaces and [lerna](https://lernajs.io) to manage internal package dependencies.

- use `yarn lerna add --scope @versionone/pkg-name dependency-pkg-name` to install dependencies into a specific component package
- also applies to internal packages; `yarn lerna add --scope @versionone/textfield @versionone/docz`
- use `yarn add -W --dev dependency-pkg-name` to install a dev dependency

## Build Tasks

Uses NPM scripts, see root `package.json` for scripts list.

## API Documentation

All components should contain appropriate `propTypes`, comments on each `propType` and `defaultProps`.

## Theme Documentation

All components should contain a `themeDefintion`. This is similar to `propTypes`, but describes the theme-able configuration properites of the component.

```js
const MyComponent = () => <span>Hello World</span>;

MyComponent.themeDefintion = {
  /** Text color */
  color: PropTypes.color,
};
```
