# Contributing Content

- pages are [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) files with the `.mdx` extension ([read more about MDX](https://mdxjs.com/))
- non-techncial guides should live in `./docs` directory
- component/package documentation should be a `README.mdx` file in each package directory
- see [Getting Started](/) for IDE extenions providing MDX support

> directory structure has **no impact** on the menu groupings

## Anatomy of an MDX File

### Frontmatter

Every `.mdx` file contains **YAML frontmatter** at the **top of the file**. This is used for metadata about the documentation page. The frontmatter specifies the **menu group**, **menu item text**, and **optional URL route**.

```mdx
---
name: My New Page
route: /custom/url/my-new-page
menu: About
---
```

### Using React Components

Components, and other JavaScript modules, can be imported into an `.mdx` file. All import statements should appear as a block immediately after the frontmatter; containing an empty newline before and after the block.

```mdx
---
name: TextField
route: /components/TextField
menu: Data Entry
---

import { Playground, PropsTable } from '@versionone/docz';
import TextField from './src';

<TextField />
```
