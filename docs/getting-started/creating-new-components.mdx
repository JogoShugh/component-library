# Creating New Components

- every component is package
- all packages are **versioned together**
- every component package has a dedicated directory under `./components`
- every component package has a correct `package.json` (see the below section, [Package File](#package-file), for more details)
- source code belongs in a `src` directory

> after creating a brand **new component package**, don't forget to run **`yarn bootstrap`**

## Package File

A valid `package.json` is required in the root of each package. To be valid, the package file must contain:

- package name with scoped to `@versionone`
- a `main` and `main:src` value
- a `files` value: all relevant files to be published; typically `["dist", "README.mdx"]`
- a build NPM script; typically `babel src --out-dir dist`

> `main:src` indicates how to locally resolve a package; the source code. `main` indicates package resolution once installed in LifeCycle and Continuum.

### Example Package.json

```json
{
  "private": false,
  "name": "@versionone/textfield",
  "description": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "main:src": "src/index.js",
  "files": ["dist", "README.mdx"],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel src --out-dir dist"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "^8.6.0 || ^10.0.0",
    "yarn": "^1.12.3"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "prop-types": "^15.6.2",
    "react": "^16.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@versionone/docz": "^0.0.0-development"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@material-ui/core": "^3.4.0"
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

Use yarn workspaces and [lerna](https://lernajs.io) to manage internal package dependencies.

- use `yarn lerna add --scope @versionone/pkg-name dependency-pkg-name` to install dependencies into a specific component package
- also applies to internal packages; `yarn lerna add --scope @versionone/textfield @versionone/docz`
- use `yarn add -W --dev dependency-pkg-name` to install a dev dependency

## Default vs Named Exports

Component packages should always export the main component as the default export. Other named exports are also allowed to be publicly exposed; just be sure to document them, too.
